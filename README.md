A tower defense game built using cocos2d-x 3.10 in c++.

I followed the tutorial here: [http://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial).

I tried really hard to follow the tutorial directly, but of course I'm using a different version of cocos2d and I did it in c++, not Objective C.
